If you are using fatjars and you want override the default langs.properties,
cluster.xml, langs.properties or any other config for the Vert.x platform (i.e.
not for the module!) then you can add them in here and they will
be added to the platform classpath when running
your module using Gradle.

They will also go into a platform_lib directory inside your module. The fatjar starter
knows to add this directory (and any jars/zips inside it) to
the Vert.x platform classpath when executing your module as a fatjar.

So use this directory only if you are using fatjars otherwise use src/main/platform_lib
