# Downloading and installing Vert.x


Vert.x requires JDK 1.7.0 or later. Make sure that the JDK is installed and on the `PATH`.

If you are using an OSX, you can install vert.x with `brew` as follows:

```
$ brew install vert.x
```

You can download brew from [brew.sh](http://brew.sh/).

If you are not using OSX, then download the distribution and follow the [examples here](http://vertx.io/install.html).

Unzip the distribution. Then add the Vert.x `bin` directory to your `PATH`.

```
$ tar -zxf ~/Downloads/vert.x-2.0.0-final.tar.gz
```

or

```
$ unzip ~/Downloads/vert.x-2.0.0-final.tar.gz
```
